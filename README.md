# Face-detection using OpenCV

This is a basic face detection project I created using Python and OpenCV.
It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time through the webcam.

**What I used:**
> Python,
> OpenCV library (cv2),
> Haar Cascade XML file for frontal face detection.

**How it works:**
> Captures video from the webcam,
> Converts each frame to grayscale,
> Detects faces using the Haar cascade,
> Draws a rectangle around each detected face.

**Purpose:**
I built this project to explore real-time computer vision and understand how face detection works using OpenCV.
